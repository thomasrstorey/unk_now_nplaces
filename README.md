# WANTERFACE
### 3/1/14
### Current version: Beta 1
Lots of bugs but it technically does all the basic things it is supposed to do. Some features to be completed. Will update soon with a todo list and list of known bugs.

# What is Wanterface?

Wanterface is an art app for Android. It uses the Google Maps API to remap the user's understanding of themselves and the world around them by blacking out everything on the map except the areas immediately surrounding where the user has personally been.

The intention is that users will be encouraged to take agency in mapping their surroundings.

### Ok, what about the title?

Want + wonder + wander + interface.
